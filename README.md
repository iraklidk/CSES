# CSES Solutions
Welcome to the CSES repository! This repository contains my solutions to the problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/), a collection of competetive programming problems.

# Overview
The CSES Problem Set is a well-known collection of algorithmic problems intended for practice and competition preparation. These solutions are my personal implementations and are intended to help others understand different approaches to solving these problems.

# Structure
The repository is organized by problem categories as outlined on the CSES Problem Set website:

- Introductory Problems
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms
- Range Queries
- Tree Algorithms
- Mathematics
- String Algorithms
- Geometry
- Advanced Techniques
- Additional Problems

Each category contains a subdirectory with the solutions for the problems within that category. Each solution file includes the problem description, my approach, and the code.
